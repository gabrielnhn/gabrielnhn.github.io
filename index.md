## About Me

Hello there, I'm a Computer Science student at [Universidade Federal do Paraná](http://bcc.ufpr.br/), and I'll be graduating soon! 

I'm interested in robotics, computer vision and machine learning.

I'm part of the [Yapira UFPR](https://www.facebook.com/ufpr.yapira) Robotics Team. Watch our computer vision-based line follower robot complete its first track at RCX 2022: {YT Links will be available soon}.
